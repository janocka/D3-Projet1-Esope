    <h1>The bald man and the fly fable</h1>
    <p>There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot summer's day.
      A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time.
      The Man aimed a blow at his little enemy, but his palm came on his head instead.
      Again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and said:
      "You will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies."</p>

    <h1>The fox and the lion</h1>
    <p>When first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly frightened, and ran away and hid himself in the wood.
      Next time however he came near the King of Beasts he stopped at a safe distance and watched him pass by.
      The third time they came near one another the Fox went straight up to the Lion and passed the time of day with him, asking him how his family were,and when he should have the pleasure of seeing him again; then turning his tail, he parted from the Lion without much ceremony.</p>

    <p>A Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her trouble.The Eagle agreed and seizing the Tortoise by the shell with her talons soared aloft.On their way they met a Crow, who said to the Eagle: "Tortoise is good eating.""The shell is too hard," said the Eagle in reply."The rocks will soon crack the shell," was the Crow's answer; and the Eagle, taking the hint, let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds made a hearty meal of the Tortoise.</p>

    <h1>The wolf and the horse</h1>
    <p>A Wolf coming out of a field of oats met with a Horse, and thus addressed him: "I would advise you to go into that field. It is full of capital oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you are a friend the very sound of whose teeth it will be a pleasure to me to hear." The Horse replied: "If oats had been the food for wolves, you would never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly."</p>
